# GamesArena

Developed a front end application which would let the users help list and browse games developed for different platforms conveniently.
Search is based on  game title and available platform.
sorting is by game rating.

To deploy this application i need the change the input data url as 
"https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/http://starlord.hackerearth.com/gamesarena"
because the given url is http and github is only accepting https and if i try to change the original url to https the request is getting failed.
